## About Us

Hey there! üëã We're **Avocloud.net**, a small team that likes to work on cool projects in our free time and share them with the world. What started as a hobby has turned into a playground where we experiment, create, and have fun developing software, Discord bots, and more.

We plan and implement ideas that are suggested by our community or that we come up with on the spot. All our projects are freely available for everyone on GitHub!

## Our Projects
